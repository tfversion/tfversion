A simple tool to manage Terraform versions.

brew install tfversion/tap/tfversion
```

## Binaries

You can download the [latest binary](https://github.com/tfversion/tfversion/releases/latest) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## Configuring your shell

To ensure that `tfversion` is always available in your shell, append the following line to your shell profile (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc or fish config):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.tfversion/bin:$PATH"
```

We prefer to not automagically modify your shell profile, and therefore leave this step to you.
